# CARTOONIFY IMAGE 

## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Project Title:** Cartoonify Image

**Team Members:**
- Nur Syahirah binti Mohd Izwan Wasandan
- Nur Aisya Fatihah binti Azhar
- Nur Afiqah binti Halim
- Afza Adawiyah binti Abdul Tahrim


- [ ] **Objectives:**
- To apply any cartoon algorithm on desired image
- To provide appealing and elegant results on image conversion
- To convert any real image into animations


## B. ABSTRACT

The popularity of photo effects applications has been on the rise thanks to popular social media platform like Instagram, Tiktok, etc. Cartoons are a common used in any kinds of applications as it is artistically made the final image looks more flawless and elegant. It is time-consuming for artist to make animations by defining the cartoon sketch properly for a good result. The traditional algorithm was developed on the base of the domain for the styling of images and they were successful in styling any images by adding effects, texture, design, etc. 

With the help of correct algorithm, many software was developed to convert real image into cartoon image. However, the results is either fail or not satisfy enough to be used by user. This is beacuse cartoon images are byzantine compared to real images. With the help of CV2 which is a library in python, the system can be successfully developed to convert those images as it gives a much more accurate results compared to previous method.

Figure 1 shows the output of image conversion from real image to cartoon image


## C. DATASET

In this project, we'll discuss about the process of converting real images into cartoon step by step.

From there, we'll review the dataset that we'll be using to train our custom image converter.

There is four steps in image conversion as shown in Figure 2:

## E. PROJECT PRESENTATION

In this project, you learned how to create an image conversion system using OpenCV and Deep Learning.

To create cartoonify image converter, we used many kind of real image to make sure the last product is success and be as perfect as possible.
